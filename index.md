# Why are we doing this ?

Being able to identify the predominant human fluxes and mobility patterns in the world is crucial for effectively modelling the spreading of diseases, establishing effective mobility connections and understanding the travelling habits of different populations. This project extension continues the exploration of human geographic movement by relating the latitude and longitude coordinates of check-ins (to the Gowalla and Brightkite social networks) to the respective countries where the localization took place. This is done with the purpose of investigating human migration patterns within and among countries. We are looking for eventual correlation between the usersâ€™ home location and their travelling destinations, possibly identifying what are the most frequent connections among countries. 

# The main questions we asked ourselves

1. What are the main fluxes of people over the world ?
2. Have some countries different trips habits than others ?
3. What is the influence of factors like the language, the distance or the GDP on travlling habits ? 

# The data

We have used datasets containing millions of check-ins in two social networks : [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html) and [Brightkite](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-brightkite.html)

You can see the distribution of these millions over the planet right there :
